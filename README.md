# Python-Course-for-Beginners
This is a repository dedicated to the python course, I am developing for my students. This is not designed for any Indian Educational board but rather has a heuristic approach to python coding.

## 🏁 Lesson Overview
This lesson introduces various looping techniques in Python, exploring different ways to iterate through collections, generate sequences, and solve computational problems efficiently.

## 📚 Loop Types Covered

| Loop Type | Description | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Range-based For Loop | Iterate over a sequence of numbers | O(n) | O(1) | Generating sequences, simple iterations |
| List Iteration | Direct iteration over list elements | O(n) | O(1) | Processing list items |
| While Loop | Conditional iteration | Varies | O(1) | Unknown iteration count, condition-based loops |
| Enumerate Loop | Simultaneous index and value iteration | O(n) | O(1) | Needing both index and value during iteration |
| Nested Loops | Loops within loops | O(n^2) | O(1) | Multi-dimensional iterations |
| List Comprehensions | Concise list creation | O(n) | O(n) | Quick list transformations |
| Generator Expressions | Memory-efficient value generation | O(n) | O(1) | Large datasets with memory constraints |

## 🧩 Code Examples

### 1. Basic Range Loop
```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
# Output: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### 2. List Iteration
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### 3. Enumerate Example
```python
languages = ['Python', 'Java', 'C++']
for index, language in enumerate(languages):
    print(f"Index {index}: {language}")
```

### 4. List Comprehension
```python
# Basic comprehension
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
# Even squares with condition
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
```

## 🚀 Advanced Technique: Sieve of Eratosthenes

### Algorithm Visualization

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Initialize Boolean Array] --> B[Mark 0 and 1 as Not Prime]
    B --> C[Iterate from 2 to sqrt(n)]
    C --> D{Is Current Number Prime?}
    D -->|Yes| E[Mark Multiples as Not Prime]
    D -->|No| F[Continue to Next Number]
    E --> F
    F --> C
    C -->|No| G[Collect Prime Numbers]

```

## 💡 Performance Tips
- Use list comprehensions for simple transformations
- Prefer generator expressions for large datasets
- Avoid deeply nested loops
- Consider built-in functions like `map()` and `filter()`

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls
1. Avoid mutating lists during iteration
2. Prevent infinite loops
3. Profile code for complex iterations
4. Prioritize code readability

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **For Loops**: Best for known iteration counts
- **While Loops**: Flexible for dynamic conditions
- **Generator Expressions**: Memory-efficient for large datasets

## 🔍 Learning Objectives
- Understand different Python looping mechanisms
- Learn when to apply specific loop types
- Optimize iteration performance
- Write more Pythonic, efficient code

## 🏗️ Setup and Running
```bash
# Ensure Python 3.x is installed
python3 complete_loop.py
```
