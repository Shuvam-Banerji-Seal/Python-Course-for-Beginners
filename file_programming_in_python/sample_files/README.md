# Sample Files Directory

This directory contains various sample files used throughout the file programming course.

## File Types Included

### Text Files
- **Basic text files** - Simple UTF-8 encoded text
- **Multilingual text** - Files with international characters
- **Configuration files** - Sample config formats
- **Log files** - Example log entries

### Binary Files
- **Image files** - Sample PNG/JPEG headers
- **Data files** - Structured binary data
- **Pickle files** - Serialized Python objects

### Special Files
- **Files with unusual extensions** - Demonstrating that extensions don't define content
- **Empty files** - For testing edge cases
- **Large files** - For performance testing (generated during examples)

## Usage

These files are created and used by the example scripts and notebooks in the course. You can:

1. **Examine them** to understand different file formats
2. **Modify them** to test your own code
3. **Create new ones** following the patterns shown

## File Naming Convention

- `demo_*.txt` - Files created by basic demonstrations
- `test_*.txt` - Files used for testing specific features
- `sample_*.txt` - General sample files for examples
- `*.bin` - Binary files
- `*.pkl` - Pickle (serialized Python object) files

## Safety Note

Some example scripts may create large files for performance testing. These are typically cleaned up automatically, but you can safely delete any large files in this directory if needed.
