# Requirements for SQL with Python notebooks
# sqlite3 is part of Python's standard library, so no installation needed
# If you need to install Python packages, use pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Python environment activation:
# source /home/shuvam/codes/.global/bin/activate

# Note: sqlite3 comes built-in with Python 2.5+ and doesn't need separate installation
