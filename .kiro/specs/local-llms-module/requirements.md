# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive educational module on local Large Language Models (LLMs) that covers practical implementation using Ollama and Hugging Face Transformers, detailed explanations of model formats, and interactive examples with system prompts. The module will be integrated into the existing Python course structure as a new section focusing on advanced AI/ML applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student learning Python, I want to understand how to run LLMs locally using Ollama, so that I can experiment with AI models without relying on cloud services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses the Ollama section THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive documentation on Ollama installation and setup
2. WHEN a student reviews Ollama features THEN the system SHALL explain model management, API usage, and configuration options with practical examples
3. WHEN a student wants to understand Ollama architecture THEN the system SHALL provide Mermaid diagrams showing the system components and workflow
4. WHEN a student needs practical examples THEN the system SHALL provide Python scripts demonstrating basic Ollama usage patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to learn about Hugging Face Transformers for local LLM deployment, so that I can understand alternative approaches to running models locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses the Transformers section THEN the system SHALL provide installation guides and basic usage examples
2. WHEN a student wants to compare approaches THEN the system SHALL explain differences between Ollama and Transformers approaches
3. WHEN a student needs practical implementation THEN the system SHALL provide Python scripts showing model loading, inference, and memory management
4. WHEN a student wants to understand performance THEN the system SHALL include examples of optimization techniques and hardware considerations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to understand different LLM model formats (GGUF, Modelfile, SafeTensors, etc.), so that I can make informed decisions about model selection and usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student reviews model formats THEN the system SHALL explain GGUF format characteristics, advantages, and use cases
2. WHEN a student learns about Ollama-specific formats THEN the system SHALL detail Modelfile structure and customization options
3. WHEN a student explores SafeTensors format THEN the system SHALL explain security benefits and compatibility considerations
4. WHEN a student needs visual understanding THEN the system SHALL provide Mermaid diagrams comparing format structures and conversion workflows
5. WHEN a student wants practical knowledge THEN the system SHALL include examples of format conversion and optimization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to experiment with system prompts that modify model behavior, so that I can understand how to customize LLM responses for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student accesses system prompt examples THEN the system SHALL provide scripts with different prompt templates (assistant, creative writer, code reviewer, etc.)
2. WHEN a student wants to understand prompt engineering THEN the system SHALL explain prompt structure, context management, and best practices
3. WHEN a student experiments with prompts THEN the system SHALL provide interactive Python scripts that demonstrate behavior changes
4. WHEN a student needs advanced techniques THEN the system SHALL include examples of few-shot learning, role-playing, and constraint-based prompting

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a student, I want setup and installation scripts, so that I can quickly get started with local LLM experimentation without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student needs Ollama setup THEN the system SHALL provide bash scripts for installation across different operating systems
2. WHEN a student wants Python environment setup THEN the system SHALL provide scripts for virtual environment creation and dependency installation
3. WHEN a student encounters issues THEN the system SHALL include troubleshooting guides and common error solutions
4. WHEN a student wants to verify installation THEN the system SHALL provide test scripts to validate the setup

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want Jupyter notebooks with interactive examples, so that I can experiment with concepts in a hands-on learning environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student opens the notebooks THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step tutorials with executable code cells
2. WHEN a student wants to understand concepts THEN the system SHALL include markdown explanations between code sections
3. WHEN a student experiments with parameters THEN the system SHALL provide interactive widgets and parameter adjustment examples
4. WHEN a student needs visualization THEN the system SHALL include plots and diagrams showing model performance and behavior

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an instructor, I want the module to integrate seamlessly with the existing course structure, so that students can access it as part of their regular curriculum.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the module is created THEN the system SHALL follow the existing course directory structure and naming conventions
2. WHEN students navigate the course THEN the system SHALL update the main README to include the new local_llms section
3. WHEN instructors review content THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency with existing documentation standards and formatting
4. WHEN the module is accessed THEN the system SHALL include proper cross-references to related course materials
