# Homework
remember to make the program dimension agnostic
take the dimension of the matrices/linear equations:
w_coeff1*w + x_coeff*x + y_coeff*y + z_coeff*z = const1
w_coeff2*w + x_coeff*x + y_coeff*y + z_coeff*z = const2
w_coeff3*w + x_coeff*x + y_coeff*y + z_coeff*z = const3


implement the determinant algorithm from scratch
to keep it simple, you will only have 3 dimensions
create the matrices, numerator matrices for w,x,y,z or whatever dimension is there

Implement the Cramer's rule to find the value of w,x,y,z or whatever variables
