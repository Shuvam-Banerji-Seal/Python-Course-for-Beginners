    "- **Text File**: A sequence of characters. Python automatically handles encoding (e.g., UTF-8) to translate characters into bytes and vice-versa. It also handles newline characters (`\\n`) differently across operating systems.\n",
    "- **Binary File**: A sequence of raw **bytes**. There is no encoding/decoding and no special handling of characters. What you write is exactly what gets stored, byte for byte.\n",

    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",

    "| **Mode** | `'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'r+'` (often with `'t'`) | `'rb'`, `'wb'`, `'ab'`, `'rb+'` (must include `'b'`) |\n",

    "- For simple byte-for-byte operations like copying files, just `read()` and `write()`.\n",
    "- For high-performance, compact storage of numerical data, use the **`struct`** module.\n",
    "- For conveniently saving and loading entire Python objects, use the **`pickle`** module (with caution!).\n",
