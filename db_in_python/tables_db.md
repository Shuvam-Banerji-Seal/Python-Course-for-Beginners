# Student Database Management using SQLite and Python

This project demonstrates how to manage a `student` table using SQLite, integrated with Python via the built-in `sqlite3` module. The program creates a table, inserts data, and performs key SQL operations such as `ALTER`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `ORDER BY`, and `GROUP BY`.

## üìÅ Files

- `student_db.py`: Python script to manage and manipulate the `student` table.
- `student.db`: SQLite database generated after running the script.

## üí° Features Implemented

### ‚úî Table Creation

Creates a `student` table with:
- `id`: Primary key (INTEGER)
- `name`: Student name (TEXT)
- `age`: Student age (INTEGER)
- `marks`: Student marks (REAL)

### ‚úî Data Insertion

Adds sample student data using `executemany`.

### ‚úî ALTER TABLE

- Adds a new column `email` using `ALTER TABLE student ADD COLUMN email TEXT`.

### ‚úî UPDATE

- Updates `email` for specific students.

### ‚úî ORDER BY

- Displays students ordered by `marks` in both ascending and descending order.

### ‚úî DELETE

- Deletes a student record (e.g., David).

### ‚úî GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions

Performs aggregate queries grouped by `age`, including:
- `COUNT(*)`
- `MIN(marks)`
- `MAX(marks)`
- `SUM(marks)`
- `AVG(marks)`

## üõ† Requirements

No external modules are required. This uses Python's built-in `sqlite3`.

```bash
python student_db.py
````

## üß† Learnings

* SQL table creation and manipulation.
* SQLite operations via Python.
* Integration of aggregate and conditional logic in SQL.
* Modifying database schema after creation.

## üìå Notes

* The script uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` to avoid duplicate primary key errors.
* Make sure to delete the `student.db` file if you want a fresh start.
