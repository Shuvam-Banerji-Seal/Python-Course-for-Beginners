# Control Structures (Weeks 4-5)

This section covers the control flow mechanisms that allow programs to make decisions and repeat actions.

## Topics Covered

- **Loops**: For loops, while loops, and iteration patterns
- **Conditional Statements**: If-else logic and decision making
- **Error Handling**: Try-except blocks and exception management
- **Recursion**: Recursive algorithms and problem-solving

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, students will:
- Control program flow with loops and conditionals
- Handle errors gracefully in their programs
- Understand and implement recursive solutions
- Write robust code that handles edge cases
