# File Programming in Python

A comprehensive guide to understanding and working with files in Python, from the fundamental concepts to advanced techniques.

## 📚 Course Structure

### 🔰 Fundamentals
1. **What is a File?** - Understanding files at the system level
2. **File Extensions and MIME Types** - Why extensions don't define file types
3. **File Encoding** - How text is stored as bytes
4. **File Modes** - Different ways to open and interact with files

### 📖 Core Concepts
5. **Basic File Operations** - Reading, writing, and manipulating files
6. **Context Managers** - The `with` statement and proper resource management
7. **File Paths and Navigation** - Working with file system paths

### 🚀 Advanced Topics
8. **Binary Files** - Working with non-text files
9. **Large File Processing** - Memory-efficient techniques
10. **Structured Data** - CSV, JSON, and other formats
11. **File System Operations** - Creating, moving, and managing files

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:
- Understand what files really are at the operating system level
- Master different file modes and when to use them
- Handle text encoding properly to avoid common errors
- Work efficiently with both text and binary files
- Process large files without running out of memory
- Use modern Python tools like `pathlib` for file operations
- Handle structured data formats like CSV and JSON

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge (variables, functions, loops)
- Understanding of strings and basic data types
- Familiarity with Python's standard library concepts
