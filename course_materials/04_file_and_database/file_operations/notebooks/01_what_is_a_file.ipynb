    "3. **Content determines file type**, not the extension\n",

    "- You can rename a `.jpg` to `.txt` and it's still an image\n",
    "- A corrupted file might have the right extension but wrong content\n",
    "- Some malware tries to hide by using innocent-looking extensions\n",
    "- Professional tools often ignore extensions and analyze content directly\n",
