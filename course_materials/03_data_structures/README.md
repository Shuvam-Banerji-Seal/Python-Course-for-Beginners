# Data Structures (Weeks 6-8)

This section covers Python's built-in data structures and their applications in problem-solving.

## Topics Covered

- **Lists, Sets, Dictionaries, Tuples**: Built-in data structures
- **Strings**: Text manipulation and processing
- **Mathematical Structures**: Matrices and vectors
- **Algorithmic Problems**: Data structure applications

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, students will:
- Choose appropriate data structures for different problems
- Manipulate and process text data effectively
- Work with mathematical data structures
