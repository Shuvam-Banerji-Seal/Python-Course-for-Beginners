# Prompt Engineering Guide

## Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve desired outputs. This guide covers fundamental concepts, best practices, and advanced techniques for creating effective prompts that work consistently across different models and use cases.

## Understanding Prompt Structure

### Basic Components

Every effective prompt consists of several key components:

1. **System Message**: Sets the overall behavior and role of the AI
2. **Context**: Provides relevant background information
3. **Task Description**: Clearly defines what you want the AI to do
4. **Input Data**: The specific content to be processed
5. **Output Format**: Specifies how the response should be structured
6. **Constraints**: Any limitations or requirements

### Prompt Anatomy Example

```
SYSTEM: You are a helpful programming assistant with expertise in Python.

CONTEXT: The user is learning about data structures and needs help with implementation.

TASK: Explain the concept and provide a working code example.

INPUT: How do I implement a stack using a list in Python?

OUTPUT FORMAT: Provide explanation followed by commented code example.

CONSTRAINTS: Keep explanations concise and code well-commented.
```

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity and Specificity

**Good**: "Write a Python function that calculates the factorial of a positive integer using recursion."

**Poor**: "Write some code for factorial."

### 2. Context Management

Provide sufficient context without overwhelming the model:

```python
# Good context management
context = """
You are reviewing Python code for a data science project. 
The code processes customer data and generates reports.
Focus on efficiency, readability, and data privacy concerns.
"""
```

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps:

```python
# Step-by-step approach
steps = [
    "1. Analyze the data structure",
    "2. Identify potential issues",
    "3. Suggest specific improvements",
    "4. Provide corrected code examples"
]
```

## Prompt Engineering Techniques

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

Direct instruction without examples:

```python
prompt = """
Analyze the following Python code for potential security vulnerabilities:

def process_user_input(user_data):
    exec(user_data)
    return "Processed"
"""
```

### 2. Few-Shot Learning

Provide examples to guide behavior:

```python
few_shot_prompt = """
Convert natural language to Python code:

Example 1:
Input: "Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10"
Output: numbers = list(range(1, 11))

Example 2:
Input: "Find the maximum value in a list called data"
Output: max_value = max(data)

Now convert:
Input: "Sort a dictionary by its values in descending order"
Output:
"""
```

### 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Encourage step-by-step reasoning:

```python
cot_prompt = """
Solve this step by step:

Problem: Debug this Python function that should return the second largest number in a list.

def second_largest(numbers):
    return sorted(numbers)[-2]

Step 1: Identify what the function is supposed to do
Step 2: Analyze the current implementation
Step 3: Identify potential issues
Step 4: Provide the corrected version
"""
```

### 4. Role-Based Prompting

Assign specific roles to guide behavior:

```python
role_prompt = """
You are a senior Python developer conducting a code review. 
You have 10 years of experience in web development and are known for:
- Writing clean, maintainable code
- Following PEP 8 standards
- Prioritizing security and performance
- Providing constructive feedback

```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Constraint-Based Prompting

Use specific constraints to guide output:

```python
constraint_prompt = """
Generate a Python class with these EXACT constraints:
- Class name must start with 'Data'
- Must have exactly 3 methods
- Each method must have a docstring
- Use type hints for all parameters
- Include error handling
- Maximum 50 lines of code
- Follow PEP 8 naming conventions
"""
```

### 2. Multi-Step Reasoning

Break complex problems into logical steps:

```python
multi_step_template = """
Solve this programming problem using structured reasoning:

PROBLEM: {problem_description}

- How to handle edge cases?
- Performance considerations
"""
```

### 3. Iterative Refinement

Use feedback loops to improve outputs:

```python
refinement_template = """
INITIAL TASK: {original_task}

REFINEMENT CRITERIA:
- Accuracy: Is the solution correct?
- Efficiency: Can it be optimized?
- Readability: Is the code clear?
- Completeness: Are all requirements met?

ITERATION PROCESS:
1. Provide initial solution
2. Self-evaluate against criteria
3. Identify improvement areas
4. Provide refined version
5. Explain improvements made
"""
```

## Context Management Strategies

### 1. Context Window Optimization

```python
def optimize_context(system_prompt, user_input, max_tokens=4000):
    """
    Optimize context to fit within token limits while preserving
    essential information.
    """
    essential_context = extract_key_information(system_prompt)
    compressed_input = summarize_if_needed(user_input, max_tokens // 2)
    
    return {
        "system": essential_context,
        "user": compressed_input,
        "estimated_tokens": estimate_tokens(essential_context + compressed_input)
    }
```

### 2. Dynamic Context Adjustment

```python
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self, base_context, max_context_length=2000):
        self.base_context = base_context
        self.max_length = max_context_length
        self.conversation_history = []
    
    def add_context(self, new_context, priority="medium"):
        """Add context with priority-based management"""
        if priority == "high":
            self.conversation_history.insert(0, new_context)
        else:
            self.conversation_history.append(new_context)
        
        self._trim_context()
    
    def _trim_context(self):
        """Keep context within limits while preserving important information"""
        total_length = len(self.base_context)
        for item in self.conversation_history:
            total_length += len(item)
            if total_length > self.max_length:
                self.conversation_history = self.conversation_history[:self.conversation_history.index(item)]
                break
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### 1. Ambiguous Instructions

**Problem**: "Make this code better"
**Solution**: "Optimize this code for readability and performance, focusing on reducing time complexity and adding clear variable names"

### 2. Insufficient Context

**Problem**: Providing code without explaining its purpose
**Solution**: Always include the context of what the code is supposed to accomplish

### 3. Overloading with Information

**Problem**: Including too much irrelevant context
**Solution**: Focus on information directly relevant to the task

### 4. Inconsistent Formatting

**Problem**: Mixing different instruction styles
**Solution**: Use consistent templates and formatting throughout

## Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

### 1. Quantitative Metrics

```python
def evaluate_prompt_effectiveness(prompt, test_cases, model):
    """
    Evaluate prompt performance across multiple test cases
    """
    results = {
        "accuracy": 0,
        "consistency": 0,
        "relevance": 0,
        "completeness": 0
    }
    
    responses = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        response = model.generate(prompt.format(**test_case))
        responses.append(response)
        
        # Evaluate each response
        results["accuracy"] += evaluate_accuracy(response, test_case["expected"])
        results["relevance"] += evaluate_relevance(response, test_case["context"])
    
    # Calculate averages
    for metric in results:
        results[metric] /= len(test_cases)
    
    results["consistency"] = calculate_consistency(responses)
    return results
```

### 2. Qualitative Assessment

- **Clarity**: Are the outputs clear and understandable?
- **Relevance**: Do responses address the specific request?
- **Completeness**: Are all aspects of the task covered?
- **Consistency**: Do similar inputs produce similar outputs?

## Prompt Templates Library

### Basic Templates

```python
BASIC_TEMPLATES = {
    "explanation": """
    Explain {topic} in simple terms.
    Target audience: {audience}
    Include practical examples and use cases.
    """,
    
    "code_generation": """
    Generate {language} code that {task_description}.
    Requirements:
    - Follow best practices
    - Include error handling
    - Add comprehensive comments
    - Provide usage examples
    """,
    
    "debugging": """
    Debug the following {language} code:
    
    {code}
    
    Expected behavior: {expected_behavior}
    Current issue: {issue_description}
    
    Provide:
    1. Root cause analysis
    2. Step-by-step fix
    3. Corrected code
    4. Prevention tips
    """
}
```
